/* and how many types of gradient are there and different ways we can use them

ChatGPT
There are several types of gradients that you can create using CSS. Here are the most commonly used gradient types:

Linear Gradient: It creates a smooth transition in a straight line between two or more colors. You can specify the direction using keywords (to top, to bottom, to left, to right) or angles (deg).
Example:

.element {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
  }
  

  Radial Gradient: It creates a circular or elliptical gradient with colors radiating from a center point. You can control the shape, size, and position of the gradient.
Example:

.element {
    background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);
  }
  
  Angular Gradient: It creates a gradient that follows the shape of a specified angle.
Example:

.element {
    background: conic-gradient(at 50% 50%, red, blue);
  }
  

  Repeating Gradient: It creates a gradient that repeats at regular intervals. It is useful for creating striped or patterned backgrounds.
Example:

.element {
    background: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, red, blue 50px);
  }
  

  Multiple Gradients: You can combine multiple gradients using comma-separated values to create complex backgrounds.
Example:

.element {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue), radial-gradient(circle, yellow, green);
  }
  

  These are just a few examples of the gradient types available in CSS. Each gradient type provides different ways to control the appearance, direction, shape, and position of the gradient. You can experiment with different combinations of colors, directions, and gradient types to achieve the desired visual effect in your designs. */
